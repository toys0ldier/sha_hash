# sha_hash
Simple script to render SHA1 and SHA256 hashes recursively when given a directory.

## Syntax:

$ python sha1hash.py <path/to/dir>

Since this is something you may want to run system-wide, you could also add this to your favote PATH location (I use /usr/local/bin but do you!). Just make sure you:

$ sudo chmod +x sha1hash

...before trying to execute it.
